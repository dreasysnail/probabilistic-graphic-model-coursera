function [Beta sigma] = FitLinearGaussianParameters(X, U)

% Estimate parameters of the linear Gaussian model:
% X|U ~ N(Beta(1)*U(1) + ... + Beta(n)*U(n) + Beta(n+1), sigma^2);

% Note that Matlab/Octave index from 1, we can't write Beta(0).
% So Beta(n+1) is essentially Beta(0) in the text book.

% X: (M x 1), the child variable, M examples
% U: (M x N), N parent variables, M examples
